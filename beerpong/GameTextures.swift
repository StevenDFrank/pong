        self.interfaceSpritesAtlas = SKTextureAtlas(named: gameSprites)  // reference with keyword 'self'. This is required inside an init method, but optional in Swift outside of init in our other methods. Some people prefer to always refer to an instance variable with self.variable. Usually chose to omit it when not required to keep code a bit more simple.
